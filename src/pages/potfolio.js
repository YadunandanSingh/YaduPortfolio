          <p>I've always been fascinated by the project-based learning approach. Passively learning facts and reciting them out of context is no longer sufficient to prepare me for solving real-world problems. Working with projects has helped me a lot in developing various skills likewise teamwork, problem-solving, research gathering, time management, information synthesizing, implementing new tools and technologies. I've personally felt these all are very essential in becoming a good software engineer and develop skills.</p>
